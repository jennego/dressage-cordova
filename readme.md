# Dressage Tests - Cordova App #

Cordova SPA using API built on Ruby on Rails. 

This is my first time using Cordova so we shall see. I chose it because Expo for React Native is painfully slow.

To do
- Get emulators working 
- Make template/design, figure out ui library 
- Get basic views (without search) working in all platforms  
- Get API working - show list, view test 

Make Android apk, test, if working add to portfolio   

Part II
- get search working
- get auto complete working 
- get offline storage working 

To support
- Show List
- Display Test
- Searches (look into searches with REST API)
- To that online and offline 
- Support Browser, Android, iOS (possibly no iOS release due to lack of device)
